    <h1>Toward Sustainable AI</h1>
    <p class="page-subtitle">
      Exploring solutions, innovations, and policies that can reduce AI’s environmental footprint.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 1: Why Sustainable AI Matters -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Why Does Sustainable AI Matter?</h2>
    <p>
      As generative AI systems grow more powerful and widely used, their energy demands and
      environmental impact also increase. Building sustainable AI means creating technologies
      that are efficient, responsible, and aligned with global climate goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of slowing innovation, sustainability encourages smarter and more intentional
      development practices that benefit people and the planet.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2: Improving Efficiency -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>1. Improving Model Efficiency</h2>
    <p>
      Researchers and engineers are developing tools and techniques to reduce the energy and
      computational cost of AI. These include:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li><strong>Model optimization</strong> — reducing the size of models while maintaining quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Quantization</strong> — storing model weights in lower precision to save energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Distillation</strong> — creating smaller “student” models that learn from a large one.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficient architectures</strong> — designing models to require fewer compute resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These strategies can significantly reduce both training and inference costs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3: Renewable-Powered Data Centers -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>2. Renewable-Powered Data Centers</h2>
    <p>
      Many technology companies are committing to powering data centers with clean energy sources,
      including wind, solar, and hydropower.
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li>Google has pledged to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy.</li>
      <li>Microsoft plans to be carbon-negative by 2030.</li>
      <li>Amazon is investing heavily in renewable energy projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Transitioning AI infrastructure to renewables is one of the most effective ways to reduce
      its carbon footprint at scale.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4: Water-Saving Cooling Methods -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>3. Water-Efficient Cooling Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Cooling AI hardware traditionally requires high water consumption. New approaches aim to
      reduce this impact:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li><strong>Closed-loop cooling</strong> — recycles water instead of releasing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid immersion cooling</strong> — submerges hardware in special fluids that cool faster.</li>
      <li><strong>Air cooling improvements</strong> — using outside air in certain climates instead of water.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These innovations help data centers operate more sustainably, especially in water-stressed areas.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 5: Smarter Use of AI Tools -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>4. Using AI More Intentionally</h2>
    <p>
      Everyday users can also contribute to sustainable AI by using these tools wisely:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li>Generating fewer unnecessary images or large datasets.</li>
      <li>Avoiding repeated prompts during brainstorming.</li>
      <li>Using smaller or local models when possible.</li>
      <li>Understanding the environmental cost of frequent AI usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Small decisions, multiplied across millions of users, can make a meaningful difference.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 6: Policy and Transparency -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>5. Policy, Transparency, and Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      Sustainable AI is not just a technical challenge it is also a policy and governance issue.
      Several measures can support more responsible development:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li><strong>Transparent reporting</strong> of energy and water use by companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental standards</strong> for data centers and AI hardware.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsible AI guidelines</strong> that include environmental impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment in green computing research</strong> and sustainable infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Policies can help ensure that AI development aligns with environmental and social goals.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 7: Looking Forward -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>The Future of Sustainable AI</h2>
    <p>
      The environmental footprint of generative AI is real, but so is its potential to contribute to
      sustainability from optimizing energy grids to improving climate models.
    </p>
    <p>
      With continued innovation, responsible design, and thoughtful use, AI can evolve into a tool
      that supports long-term environmental well-being.
