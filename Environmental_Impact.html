    <h1>Environmental Impact of Generative AI</h1>
    <p class="page-subtitle">
      How energy, water, and infrastructure power today’s AI systems — and what that means for the planet.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 1: Big Picture -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Why Does Generative AI Have an Environmental Impact?</h2>
    <p>
      Generative AI is not just “in the cloud” it runs on physical machines in data centers
      around the world. These facilities require electricity, cooling, hardware, and constant
      maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As more people use AI tools for writing, images, search, and coding, the total demand for
      computing power grows. That demand translates into higher energy use, more water for cooling,
      and a larger carbon footprint.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2: Energy Use -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Energy Use</h2>
    <p>
      Training and running generative AI models require large numbers of high-performance graphics
      processing units (GPUs) or specialized AI chips. These chips draw significant power when:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li><strong>Training</strong> a model running it for days or weeks on huge datasets.</li>
      <li><strong>Inference</strong> answering user prompts millions of times a day.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Data centers that host AI systems often consume as much electricity as small towns. If that
      electricity comes from fossil fuels, the carbon emissions associated with AI can be substantial.

      <p><strong>Key idea:</strong> The more complex the model and the more people who use it, the
        more electricity is required to keep it running.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3: Water & Cooling -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Water and Cooling</h2>
    <p>
      AI data centers generate a lot of heat. To prevent hardware from overheating, facilities use
      cooling systems that often rely on large volumes of water.
    </p>

    <p>
      Water may be used to:
    </p>
    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li>Cool equipment directly through evaporation or chillers.</li>
      <li>Support nearby power plants that supply electricity to the data center.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In regions already experiencing drought or water stress, this extra demand can put pressure on
      local water supplies and ecosystems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4: Carbon Footprint & Infrastructure -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Carbon Footprint and Physical Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      The climate impact of AI comes from the full lifecycle of its infrastructure:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li>Producing chips, servers, and networking equipment.</li>
      <li>Constructing and operating data centers.</li>
      <li>Generating the electricity that powers training and inference.</li>
      <li>Eventually disposing of or recycling outdated hardware.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If a data center is powered primarily by fossil fuels, its carbon footprint will be
      significantly higher than one powered by wind, solar, or other renewable sources.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 5: Who Feels the Impact? -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Who Is Most Affected?</h2>
    <p>
      The environmental costs of AI are not distributed evenly. Communities living near data centers
      or power plants may experience:
    </p>

    <ul class="clean-list">
      <li>Increased local water use.</li>
      <li>Higher demand on electrical grids.</li>
      <li>Potential air pollution from fossil-fuel power sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At the same time, many of the benefits of AI tools are concentrated in wealthier regions and
      organizations, raising questions about environmental justice and equity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 6: Putting It in Perspective -->
  <section class="info-section">
    <h2>Putting the Impact in Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Generative AI is only one part of the wider technology sector, but it is a fast-growing one.
      Understanding its environmental footprint helps us make more informed choices about when and
      how we use these tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not to say “never use AI,” but to ask how we can develop and deploy it in ways
      that are more efficient, transparent, and responsible.
